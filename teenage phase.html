          <p>A lot of younger people struggle with this type of insecureness. Even myself. I mean, I tell everyone that looks are subjective and they're cool the way they are and I believe that but on the other hand I look into the mirror and wonder if I'm too fat or why my hair doesn't look nice. I also have those periods where I feel handsome. I think the real question is not ‘do I look good’ or ‘do others consider me good looking’ but rather ‘do I like how I look’ because we want to be confident about ourselves. Everybody says that looks don't matter or that we shouldn't think about it. Well, we shouldn't, but yet we do. I think being confident or at least acting like you are helps you come over more attractive. Don't be scared to talk to people, some just find you beautiful and others don't, that's not just with you but with everyone. Some people might find a specific person attractive that others personally don't. This doesn't mean that there is something wrong with that person and that they should feel bad, everybody just has different opinions. But remember this, someone does find you attractive. This is how far I can try to help you with the information I have but feel free to tell me more about your situation and maybe I come up with something then? </p>

          <p>You are feeling concerned out this change, this much clear. But how long ago did the change occur? A month, a year? As sometimes, something that have happened make us change our course, and normally recover by ourselves after sometime.</p>

          <p>The first thing you should realize is that talking to people is a skill. And as all skills go, the more you practice it, the better you get. So you can't get better at talking to people and then go talk to people. You get better at talking to people by talking to people.</p>

          <p>Some way, somehow, distance yourself from those who think poorly of you, or are condescending/belittling.  Honest critiques might be okay if they're actionable and you're interested in improving, but if it's just comments about you, the way you are, and your beliefs, that shouldn't fly.  You are not going to be able to stop caring about what others think of you.  Everyone does.  You can rationalize to some degree, but the negativity WILL sweep in.  It's a toxic situation, and you need to escape it!</p>
